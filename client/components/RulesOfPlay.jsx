            <List.Item>Your team score is measured in minutes. The fewer minutes, the better.</List.Item>
            <List.Item>From puzzle timer start, you have 70 minutes to finish that puzzle (15 minutes for meta puzzle). <b>Note:</b> We increased the finish time by 5 minutes to account for download and print time.</List.Item>
            <List.Item>If you do not finish in 70 minutes you are given the code word(s) and receive a score of 105 minutes for that puzzle (25 minutes for meta).</List.Item>
            <List.Item>There is no penalty for incorrect code word entries.</List.Item>
            <List.Item>Each primary puzzle has 3 hints available.</List.Item>
            <List.Item>Teams may "buy" hints. Cost increases per hint: any hint taken 1st, 2nd, or 3rd (in any order) adds 5, 10, or 15 minutes respectively, to your score.</List.Item>
            <List.Item>Hints are progressive and teams may "buy" them in any order. (e.g., You may choose to only "buy" hint 3 near the end of a puzzle at a cost of 5 minutes).</List.Item>
            <List.Item>Bonus: If you finish within 70 minutes and do not use any hints, 10 minutes are subtracted from your score! (No hints or bonus available for meta.)</List.Item>
